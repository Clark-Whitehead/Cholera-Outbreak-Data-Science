# Cholera outbreak of 1854 visualized with Plotly/Dash

### Plotly Website

The results from the Reddit Sentiment and Stock Price notebook above has been included in a plotly website (coded in Python using Dash). We also included a bar graph depicting which Disney characters were discussed the most on the r/Disney subreddit, as well as an interactive map of Disneyland with each ride's sentiment (taken from r/Disneyland) being displayed. 

In order to access the website, the python application must be running. This can be done by cloning this repository locally: 

```
git clone git@github.com:Clark-Whitehead/data_viz_final_project.git
```

After cloning, navigate into the repository's directory:

```
cd data_viz_final_project
```

Run the python program (note: make sure python3 is installed on your computer):

```
python3 app.py
```

Finally, open an internet browswer of your choice and navigate to the following url:

```
http://localhost:3030/
```

Alternatively, you can email <clark37@hawaii.edu> to schedule a viewing.
